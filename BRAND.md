# Brand Contract (MANDATORY)

## Asset Locations
- Primary logo: /public/brand/logo.svg
- Fallback logo: /public/brand/logo.png
- Icon: /public/brand/icon.png
- Images: /public/images/*

## Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- If a logo file exists, it MUST be used in the site header.
- Prefer SVG over PNG.
- Use next/image for all photos.
- Do NOT invent logos or placeholder images.
- If assets are missing, leave TODO comments instead.

## Styling
- If a logo exists, infer brand colors and apply them to:
  - header
  - primary buttons
  - accents
- Keep it minimal and consistent.
