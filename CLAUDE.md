You are working in a Next.js App Router project.

## Required Reading Order
1. BRAND.md
2. TASKS.md
3. workflow/intake.md

If BRAND.md defines assets, they MUST be used.


Global rules:
- Use TypeScript + Tailwind only
- Do NOT add dependencies
- Do NOT modify config files unless explicitly told
- Do NOT redesign layouts unless told
- Prefer small, surgical changes
- Stop when the task phase is complete and report what changed
